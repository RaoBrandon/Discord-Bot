# Discord-Bot
This Discord Bot can be implemented into text channels on the Discord chat service and display memes, tell jokes and detect other chat prompts such as cursing . It contains the essential supplementary files to make the project run. For images to be displayed by the bot they must be numbered and in the same folder as the bot.
